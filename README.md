# YAMS - Yet Another Mine Sweeper



This game was originally written in **Delphi 7** at the end of 2003 as a learning exercise of both Object Pascal language and Windows game programming.

The original source code was published in the good old Delphi Pages site which now is, unfortunately, dead. It was an awesome lucky moment when I found a nearly finished version of its source in a dusty backup CDROM and now I'm making it available again on Git Hub.

It opened and was compiled flawlessly 21 years after, in Delphi 12. Dude, that's just awesome!!! :open_mouth:

This is how it looks on Windows 11.
